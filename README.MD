# Space Invaders Game

![Game Screenshot](game_screenshot.png)

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my very first game project, and I'm excited to share it with you. I've created a simple Space Invaders game using Python and the Pygame library.

This project is a fun and straightforward implementation of the classic Space Invaders game. It's been a fantastic learning experience for me as I delve into the world of game development.
